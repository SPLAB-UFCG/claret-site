# About Claret Grammar

Claret has structure and syntax containing the main fields required by a use case document: 

- systemName
- usecase
- actor
- preCondition
- postCondition
- basic
- alternative
- exception

All fields are aligned with the [UML use case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) definition, minimizing the learning curve of Claret.
