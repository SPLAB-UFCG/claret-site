#### Overview

Claret generates two main outputs:

- TGF files destined to:
  - Graphically validate all use case paths through yEd tool;
  - Support test suites generation by a third-party tool called LTS-BT.
- An ODT file which contains a formatted report to each use case.

#### TGF Artifacts

Each use case will generate two tgf files: one with a graph of all paths from use cases, and another with annotated edges to describe conditions, user steps and responses from system.
